          Through our Exchange there is no need for airlines to maintain high cost components in their inventories.
          All the exchange units are provided with full certification, traceability and warranty. The exchange units
          are shipped the same day to avoid AOG situations and keep
          the aircraft flying, without any increase in inventory costs.
